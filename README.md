This package contains nodes to easily connect to BMW ConnectedDrive and read out informations about your vehicles.

NOTE: These nodes are unofficial and do NOT COME from BMW AG. Be careful when using these.

Be careful not to send your login and password to anyone other than BMW or you are giving away the authentication details required to control your car.

Also ensure that you don't overwhelm the BMW servers with requests. Calling REST APIs at very high frequency can put substantial load on the servers and might get your IP blocked by BMW.

## Disclaimer

Use these nodes at your own risk. The authors do not guaranteed the proper functioning of these nodes.
This code attempts to use the same interfaces used by the official BMW ConnectedDrive web portal.
However, it is possible that use of this code may cause unexpected damage for which nobody but you are responsible.
Use of these functions can change the settings on your car and may have negative consequences such as (but not limited to)
reducing the available charge in the battery.

## Installation

Install using the managed palette from inside Node-RED.
